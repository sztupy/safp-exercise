# Problem Statement

Please see https://gist.github.com/safplatform/792314da6b54346594432f30d5868f36

# To run

You can run the file against the standard input or against any file(s):

```
$ ./main.rb examples/input1.txt
```

# Tests

Please run

```
$ ./test.sh
```

To check solution against test input

# Notes

The example output of example 3 has been changed from containing `3 box` to `3 boxes` to align with the input, as inflection support was not part of the original problem statement, and external tools like Rail's inflection library are not supported
